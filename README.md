##### Challenges :

For this assignment there weren't many issues. I had a bit of a difficult time with sass but I realised in the end I wasn't calling the individual files in the main.scss.
Other than that, I just had a bit of difficulty with my time keeping this weekend due to sickness. I'm sure if I had spent time on it I would've been able to produce something much better than what I have now, will definetly do it again.

##### Take-Aways :

All in all, I'm happy that I get the concept. I did this one from scratch since I wanted to make sure I understood everything and how it all worked together. 
I just wish I had spent more time on it but I'll keep working on it and on the time management skills.

I give it a 5/10. Could do better.
